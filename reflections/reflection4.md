## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We fixed a large number of bugs and got very helpful feedback during this week's bug bash.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 BUGS! 
 In particular, sending emails no longer works after deployment. Also, managing state for ratings and replies was difficult. Passing props between components also caused numerous bugs.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes. We caught up on everything from Sprint 3 and managed to complete all of our Sprint 4 goals.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We continue to appreciate the support from the instructors as well as occasionally reference past labs.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 At this point, we have finalized all of our main feautures and none are at risk. Some stretch goals will likely be let unfinished.

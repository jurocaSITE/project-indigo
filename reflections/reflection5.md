## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 

Just right: We were able to finish all the main/MVP features that we originally planned for unless it was not possible to do with our APIs. We also completed many stretch features but still have room to make improvements.

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing what you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?

If we were starting over with the knowledge we have now, we would have liked to learn some simple testing methods so that we could implement tests throughout our sprints. 

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?

The labs and assignments were very helpful, except for some that we did not get through partially/completely. For example, some of us did not finish the test/TDD lab or the advanced React lab which would have been helpful to know for the project. 

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)

All of these resources were equally helpful and essential to the process. Weekly pod syncs with mentors allowed us to get helpful feedback. The ideation process was very thorough for our group because we started with many potential project ideas but ultimately narrowed it down to one. Wireframes were the blueprint of our project and we stuck very closely to the original design. Sprint planning/stand ups were very helpful for keeping us on track. Bug bash and demo day were great for preparing us for the final demo day and finding features in our website to improve.

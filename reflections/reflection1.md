## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

One successful thing has been constant and thorough communication between our group which has allowed us to navigate any changes to our initial planning as well as accomplish a lot of features in our first sprint. We have been taking breaks when needed and established a good schedule that includes both individual and group development. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

One challenge was getting acclimated with git merge/push/pull flows since this was a new skill that our team had to learn. Another challenge was technical issues with our API (google books api). We are finding solutions to the API challenge now and a proposed solution has been using an additional API that covers the information we want.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We haven't completed all the tasks in our sprint plan for the first week yet. We have started every user story in this sprint but have not completely finished 50% of them (either the frontend is needed or something else). This is because we did some reprioritizing of user stories and pulled multiple stories from sprint 2. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Many of the labs and previous assignment video walk-throughs/code bases helped us complete stories from this sprint. We also used external resources like react icons (found from a YouTube video), W3 schools documents, and stackoverflow. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Currently, certain information on the authors pages are at risk because we don't yet have a solution for how to generate that info. This affects all author-related user stories. Right now we are considering using default text/data that doesn't necessarily match a specific author's info if we don't find a solution. A solution we are looking into is pulling info from the Wiki API.

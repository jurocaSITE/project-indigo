## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Our pod finished the MVP with all the core features we had planned to implement during the first two sprints! 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We ran into many challenging bugs over the course of the week, including problems related to routing, merging, and styling/HTML.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes we finished all of the tasks in our sprint plan for this week. We switched one task out for another from week 3 (author page -> some review functionality).

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Besides getting help from instructors and TAs when needed, all of the resources we used were outside resources including W3schools, Stackoverflow, YouTube tutorials, and CSS style guides. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The author page is still a risk feature (like we said last week). For now we are just rendering books that the authors have written, not any personal information about them. If we do not end up finding a solution to getting their personal info, the author page will just have books they have written.
